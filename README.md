# UoB-Computer-Vision-Assignment-MRI-Segmentation-

The objective is to design and develop an 2D and 3D image processing algorithm that will segment a consecutive MRI axial cross section. The classes that are needed to segment are : Air (class0), Skin/Scalp(class1), Skull(class2), CSF(class3), Gray Matter(class4) and White Matter(class5). Analyze the outcome between 2D and 3D, and conclude the observations with appropriate reason.
